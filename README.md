# network-based-services
Projects for the university module called T120B180 Development and Deployment of Network Based Services.

All lab works implement remote interactions between a server (lake) and clients (fishes and fishermen).
Each lab work achieves the same result using different protocols or architectural constrains:
1. gRPC;
2. REST and SOAP;
3. message queues with RabbitMQ;
4. combination of REST, SOAP and gRPC.
